This plugin, if loaded, causes the Hostname to be taken from the machine's
UUID. The UUID is a universally unique designation for the machine, usually
taken from the machine's BIOS. This is most useful if the machine is running in
a virtual environment such as Xen, in which case the UUID is preserved across
shutdowns and migration.


The following methods are used to find the machine's UUID, in order:

</property>
    <property name="use_markup">True</property>
  </object>
  <object class="GtkGrid" id="uuid">
    <property name="visible">True</property>
    <property name="can_focus">False</property>
  </object>
