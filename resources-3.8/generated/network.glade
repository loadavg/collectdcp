The Network plugin sends data to a remote instance of collectd, receives data
from a remote instance, or both at the same time. Data which has been received
from the network is usually not transmitted again, but this can be activated, see
the Forward option below.


The default IPv6 multicast group is ff18::efc0:4a42. The default IPv4
multicast group is 239.192.74.66. The default UDP port is 25826.


Both, Server and Listen can be used as single option or as block. When
used as block, given options are valid for this socket only. The following
example will export the metrics twice: Once to an "internal" server (without
encryption and signing) and one to an external server (with cryptographic
signature):



 &lt;Plugin "network"&gt;
   # Export to an internal server
   # (demonstrates usage without additional options)
   Server "collectd.internal.tld"



   # Export to an external server
   # (demonstrates usage with signature options)
   &lt;Server "collectd.external.tld"&gt;
     SecurityLevel "sign"
     Username "myhostname"
     Password "ohl0eQue"
   &lt;/Server&gt;
 &lt;/Plugin&gt;

The Server statement/block sets the server to send datagrams to. The
statement may occur multiple times to send each datagram to multiple
destinations.
The argument Host may be a hostname, an IPv4 address or an IPv6 address. The
optional second argument specifies a port number or a service name. If not
given, the default, 25826, is used.
The following options are recognized within Server blocks:
SecurityLevel Encrypt|Sign|None
Set the security you require for network communication. When the security level
has been set to Encrypt, data sent over the network will be encrypted using
AES-256. The integrity of encrypted packets is ensured using SHA-1. When
set to Sign, transmitted data is signed using the HMAC-SHA-256 message
authentication code. When set to None, data is sent without any security.
This feature is only available if the network plugin was linked with
libgcrypt.
Username Username
Sets the username to transmit. This is used by the server to lookup the
password. See AuthFile below. All security levels except None require
this setting.
This feature is only available if the network plugin was linked with
libgcrypt.
Password Password
Sets a password (shared secret) for this socket. All security levels except
None require this setting.
This feature is only available if the network plugin was linked with
libgcrypt.
Interface Interface name
Set the outgoing interface for IP packets. This applies at least
to IPv6 packets and if possible to IPv4. If this option is not applicable,
undefined or a non-existent interface name is specified, the default
behavior is to let the kernel choose the appropriate interface. Be warned
that the manual selection of an interface for unicast traffic is only
necessary in rare cases.
ResolveInterval Seconds
Sets the interval at which to re-resolve the DNS for the Host. This is
useful to force a regular DNS lookup to support a high availability setup. If
not specified, re-resolves are never attempted.

The Listen statement sets the interfaces to bind to. When multiple
statements are found the daemon will bind to multiple interfaces.
The argument Host may be a hostname, an IPv4 address or an IPv6 address. If
the argument is a multicast address the daemon will join that multicast group.
The optional second argument specifies a port number or a service name. If not
given, the default, 25826, is used.
The following options are recognized within &lt;Listen&gt; blocks:
SecurityLevel Encrypt|Sign|None
Set the security you require for network communication. When the security level
has been set to Encrypt, only encrypted data will be accepted. The integrity
of encrypted packets is ensured using SHA-1. When set to Sign, only
signed and encrypted data is accepted. When set to None, all data will be
accepted. If an AuthFile option was given (see below), encrypted data is
decrypted if possible.
This feature is only available if the network plugin was linked with
libgcrypt.
AuthFile Filename
Sets a file in which usernames are mapped to passwords. These passwords are
used to verify signatures and to decrypt encrypted network packets. If
SecurityLevel is set to None, this is optional. If given, signed data is
verified and encrypted packets are decrypted. Otherwise, signed data is
accepted without checking the signature and encrypted data cannot be decrypted.
For the other security levels this option is mandatory.
The file format is very simple: Each line consists of a username followed by a
colon and any number of spaces followed by the password. To demonstrate, an
example file could look like this:

  user0: foo
  user1: bar
Each time a packet is received, the modification time of the file is checked
using stat(2). If the file has been changed, the contents is re-read. While
the file is being read, it is locked using fcntl(2).
Interface Interface name
Set the incoming interface for IP packets explicitly. This applies at least
to IPv6 packets and if possible to IPv4. If this option is not applicable,
undefined or a non-existent interface name is specified, the default
behavior is, to let the kernel choose the appropriate interface. Thus incoming
traffic gets only accepted, if it arrives on the given interface.

Set the time-to-live of sent packets. This applies to all, unicast and
multicast, and IPv4 and IPv6 packets. The default is to not change this value.
That means that multicast packets will be sent with a TTL of 1 (one) on most
operating systems.

Set the maximum size for datagrams received over the network. Packets larger
than this will be truncated. Defaults to 1452Â bytes, which is the maximum
payload size that can be transmitted in one Ethernet frame using IPv6Â /
UDP.
On the server side, this limit should be set to the largest value used on
any client. Likewise, the value on the client must not be larger than the
value on the server, or data will be lost.
Compatibility: Versions prior to versionÂ 4.8 used a fixed sized
buffer of 1024Â bytes. Versions 4.8, 4.9 and 4.10 used a default
value of 1024Â bytes to avoid problems when sending data to an older
server.

If set to true, write packets that were received via the network plugin to
the sending sockets. This should only be activated when the Listen- and
Server-statements differ. Otherwise packets may be send multiple times to
the same multicast group. While this results in more network traffic than
necessary it's not a huge problem since the plugin has a duplicate detection,
so the values will not loop.

The network plugin cannot only receive and send statistics, it can also create
statistics about itself. Collected data included the number of received and
sent octets and packets, the length of the receive queue and the number of
values handled. When set to true, the Network plugin will make these
statistics available. Defaults to false.
