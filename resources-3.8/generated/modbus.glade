Data blocks define a mapping between register numbers and the "types" used by
collectd.
Within &lt;Data /&gt; blocks, the following options are allowed:
RegisterBase Number
Configures the base register to read from the device. If the option
RegisterType has been set to Uint32 or Float, this and the next
register will be read (the register number is increased by one).
RegisterType Int16|Int32|Uint16|Uint32|Float
Specifies what kind of data is returned by the device. If the type is Int32,
Uint32 or Float, two 16 bit registers will be read and the data is
combined into one value. Defaults to Uint16.
RegisterCmd ReadHolding|ReadInput
Specifies register type to be collected from device. Works only with libmodbus
2.9.2 or higher. Defaults to ReadHolding.
Type Type
Specifies the "type" (data set) to use when dispatching the value to
collectd. Currently, only data sets with exactly one data source are
supported.
Instance Instance
Sets the type instance to use when dispatching the value to collectd. If
unset, an empty string (no type instance) is used.

Host blocks are used to specify to which hosts to connect and what data to read
from their "slaves". The string argument Name is used as hostname when
dispatching the values to collectd.
Within &lt;Host /&gt; blocks, the following options are allowed:
Address Hostname
For Modbus/TCP, specifies the node name (the actual network address) used to
connect to the host. This may be an IP address or a hostname. Please note that
the used libmodbus library only supports IPv4 at the moment.
Port Service
for Modbus/TCP, specifies the port used to connect to the host. The port can
either be given as a number or as a service name. Please note that the
Service argument must be a string, even if ports are given in their numerical
form. Defaults to "502".
Device Devicenode
For Modbus/RTU, specifies the path to the serial device being used.
Baudrate Baudrate
For Modbus/RTU, specifies the baud rate of the serial device.
Note, connections currently support only 8/N/1.
Interval Interval
Sets the interval (in seconds) in which the values will be collected from this
host. By default the global Interval setting will be used.
&lt;Slave ID&gt;
Over each connection, multiple Modbus devices may be reached. The slave ID
is used to specify which device should be addressed. For each device you want
to query, one Slave block must be given.
Within &lt;Slave /&gt; blocks, the following options are allowed:
Instance Instance
Specify the plugin instance to use when dispatching the values to collectd.
By default "slave_ID" is used.
Collect DataName
Specifies which data to retrieve from the device. DataName must be the same
string as the Name argument passed to a Data block. You can specify this
option multiple times to collect more than one value from a slave. At least one
Collect option is mandatory.
