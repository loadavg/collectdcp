EXPERIMENTAL! See notes below.


The onewire plugin uses the owcapi library from the owfs project
http://owfs.org/ to read sensors connected via the onewire bus.


It can be used in two possible modes - standard or advanced.


In the standard mode only temperature sensors (sensors with the family code
10, 22 and 28 - e.g. DS1820, DS18S20, DS1920) can be read. If you have
other sensors you would like to have included, please send a sort request to
the mailing list. You can select sensors to be read or to be ignored depending
on the option IgnoreSelected). When no list is provided the whole bus is
walked and all sensors are read.


Hubs (the DS2409 chips) are working, but read the note, why this plugin is
experimental, below.


In the advanced mode you can configure any sensor to be read (only numerical
value) using full OWFS path (e.g. "/uncached/10.F10FCA000800/temperature").
In this mode you have to list all the sensors. Neither default bus walk nor
IgnoreSelected are used here. Address and type (file) is extracted from
the path automatically and should produce compatible structure with the "standard"
mode (basically the path is expected as for example
"/uncached/10.F10FCA000800/temperature" where it would extract address part
"F10FCA000800" and the rest after the slash is considered the type - here
"temperature").
There are two advantages to this mode - you can access virtually any sensor
(not just temperature), select whether to use cached or directly read values
and it is slighlty faster. The downside is more complex configuration.


The two modes are distinguished automatically by the format of the address.
It is not possible to mix the two modes. Once a full path is detected in any
Sensor then the whole addressing (all sensors) is considered to be this way
(and as standard addresses will fail parsing they will be ignored).

Sets the device to read the values from. This can either be a "real" hardware
device, such as a serial port or an USB port, or the address of the
owserver(1) socket, usually localhost:4304.
Though the documentation claims to automatically recognize the given address
format, with versionÂ 2.7p4 we had to specify the type explicitly. So
with that version, the following configuration worked for us:

  &lt;Plugin onewire&gt;
    Device "-s localhost:4304"
  &lt;/Plugin&gt;
This directive is required and does not have a default value.

In the standard mode selects sensors to collect or to ignore
(depending on IgnoreSelected, see below). Sensors are specified without
the family byte at the beginning, so you have to use for example F10FCA000800,
and not include the leading 10. family byte and point.
When no Sensor is configured the whole Onewire bus is walked and all supported
sensors (see above) are read.
In the advanced mode the Sensor specifies full OWFS path - e.g.
/uncached/10.F10FCA000800/temperature (or when cached values are OK
/10.F10FCA000800/temperature). IgnoreSelected is not used.
As there can be multiple devices on the bus you can list multiple sensor (use
multiple Sensor elements).

If no configuration is given, the onewire plugin will collect data from all
sensors found. This may not be practical, especially if sensors are added and
removed regularly. Sometimes, however, it's easier/preferred to collect only
specific sensors or all sensors except a few specified ones. This option
enables you to do that: By setting IgnoreSelected to true the effect of
Sensor is inverted: All selected interfaces are ignored and all other
interfaces are collected.
Used only in the standard mode - see above.
