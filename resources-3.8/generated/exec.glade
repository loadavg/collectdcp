Please make sure to read collectd-exec(5) before using this plugin. It
contains valuable information on when the executable is executed and the
output that is expected from it.

Execute the executable Executable as user User. If the user name is
followed by a colon and a group name, the effective group is set to that group.
The real group and saved-set group will be set to the default group of that
user. If no group is given the effective group ID will be the same as the real
group ID.
Please note that in order to change the user and/or group the daemon needs
superuser privileges. If the daemon is run as an unprivileged user you must
specify the same user/group here. If the daemon is run with superuser
privileges, you must supply a non-root user here.
The executable may be followed by optional arguments that are passed to the
program. Please note that due to the configuration parsing numbers and boolean
values may be changed. If you want to be absolutely sure that something is
passed as-is please enclose it in quotes.
The Exec and NotificationExec statements change the semantics of the
programs executed, i.Â e. the data passed to them and the response
expected from them. This is documented in great detail in collectd-exec(5).
