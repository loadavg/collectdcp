The Aggregation plugin makes it possible to aggregate several values into
one using aggregation functions such as sum, average, min and max.
This can be put to a wide variety of uses, e.g. average and total CPU
statistics for your entire fleet.


The grouping is powerful but, as with many powerful tools, may be a bit
difficult to wrap your head around. The grouping will therefore be
demonstrated using an example: The average and sum of the CPU usage across
all CPUs of each host is to be calculated.


To select all the affected values for our example, set Plugin cpu and
Type cpu. The other values are left unspecified, meaning "all values". The
Host, Plugin, PluginInstance, Type and TypeInstance options
work as if they were specified in the WHERE clause of an SELECT SQL
statement.



  Plugin "cpu"
  Type "cpu"


Although the Host, PluginInstance (CPU number, i.e. 0, 1, 2, ...)  and
TypeInstance (idle, user, system, ...) fields are left unspecified in the
example, the intention is to have a new value for each host / type instance
pair. This is achieved by "grouping" the values using the GroupBy option.
It can be specified multiple times to group by more than one field.



  GroupBy "Host"
  GroupBy "TypeInstance"


We do neither specify nor group by plugin instance (the CPU number), so all
metrics that differ in the CPU number only will be aggregated. Each
aggregation needs at least one such field, otherwise no aggregation would
take place.


The full example configuration looks like this:



 &lt;Plugin "aggregation"&gt;
   &lt;Aggregation&gt;
     Plugin "cpu"
     Type "cpu"



     GroupBy "Host"
     GroupBy "TypeInstance"



     CalculateSum true
     CalculateAverage true
   &lt;/Aggregation&gt;
 &lt;/Plugin&gt;
